## About Path Planning Project

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* The goal of this project is to build a path planner that creates smooth, safe trajectories for the car to follow. The highway track has other vehicles, all going different speeds, but approximately obeying the 50 MPH speed limit. The car transmits its location, along with its sensor fusion data, which estimates the location of all the vehicles on the same side of the road.
* More detail explanation can be found in [README](https://github.com/pl80tech/CarND-Path-Planning-Project/blob/master/README.md)

## Project code

Here is my working repository for this project:

https://github.com/pl80tech/CarND-Path-Planning-Project.git

It is imported and frequently updated (cherry-pick or merge) from below original repository:

https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project.git

## Rubric Points

Here are the [Rubric Points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1971/view) which need to be addressed to meet the requirements of this project. Each point/criteria is explained in next sections.

## Code compilation

The final solution is implemented in [/src/main.cpp](https://github.com/pl80tech/CarND-Path-Planning-Project/blob/master/src/main.cpp) and it can be compiled successfully with **cmake** and **make** (as explained in [README](https://github.com/pl80tech/CarND-Path-Planning-Project/blob/master/README.md)).

```shell
$ cmake ..
-- The C compiler identification is GNU 5.4.0

```

Some tests (test1 ~ test7) are implemented in [main_test.cpp](https://github.com/pl80tech/CarND-Path-Planning-Project/blob/master/src/main_test.cpp) with correspondent compile definition **-DTEST1** ~ **-DTEST7**. It can be compile by adding the definition and specifying the target source code in [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/pl80tech/CarND-Path-Planning-Project/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) as below:

```cmake
add_definitions(-DTEST1)

set(sources src/main_test.cpp)
```

## Valid Trajectories

As shown on [Output video](#Output-video), the trajectories generated by final solution are valid and can meet all the required specifications.

* The car is able to drive more than 7 miles without incident
* The car drives according to the speed limit (moving as fast as possible but always less than 50mph)
* Max Acceleration and Jerk are not exceeded (no red warning)
* Car does not have collisions
* The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes
* The car is able to change lanes when necessary

---
## Reflection

## Path generation and planning

The main code to generate the trajectory, control the velocity & decide the driving lane is implemented in *main()* function on [main.cpp](https://github.com/pl80tech/CarND-Path-Planning-Project/blob/master/src/main.cpp) (line 294 ~ line 474) with detail comment for each process. Here are some main points of the implemention:

* Get the data from sensor fusion and use below functions to detect the cars moving in each lane for further processing (line 309 ~ line 345)
	* *getLane():* get lane of other car from d information
	* *isAhead():* check whether other car is moving ahead in close range or not
	* *isClose():* check whether other car is in close range or not
	* *isTarget():* check whether other car is a target for further checking
* Use below flags (set in above process) to decide the lane and velocity for next trajectory (line 347 ~ line 368)
	* *isCarAhead*: whether there is a car moving closely ahead
	* *isCarLeft*: whether there is a car moving closely on left lane
	* *isCarRight*: whether there is a car moving closely on right lane
* Use the points from previous trajectory and some new poinst generated by spline open source library (mentioned in [Reference](#Reference)) to create the next trajectory when moving forward or changing to left/right lane (line 370 ~ line 474)

## Further improvement

Here are some ideas which may help to improve the performance of current solution.

* Take into account the speed of the cars moving on left or right lane to avoid potential collision in some specific cases (for example when the cars in other lanes change the speed very fastly while lane changing is being executed, etc)
* Dynamically change the safe distance correspondent to the reference velocity (need to be optimized) instead of using a constant  (SAFE_DISTANCE = 30) in current solution.
